- CNN is a neural network optimized for sound, image, and video classification. It's a NN that was praised for winning Kaggle's Image Classification Competition of written integers ranging from 0 - 9. 

## Building a CNN is composed of three challenging steps:
1. Forward propogation (Easy)
2. Backward propogation (Hardest)
3. Parameter updates (Hard)
